# LSTMImageCaptioning
Improved Image Captioning Based on the Google Image Captioning

This is repository of one of final undergraduate works of our student in UPF. This work addresses the challenge on improving the baseline of im2txt model of tensorflow with the attention mechanism. 

This works specifically combines the attention mechanism on https://github.com/tensorflow/nmt to the see and tell model of 
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/im2txt. 

Requirements : 
  1. Base of Im2text model 
  2. The other file on env.yml 
  
 Main source code : evaluate.py
 The implementation of attentions : show_and_tell_model.py
